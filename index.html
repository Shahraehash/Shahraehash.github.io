									<p>We trained three Markov Models to model the change of methylation sites
										with respect to age in individuals with type 1 diabetes and healthy individuals.
										We prune and structurally compare Markov Models to identify distinct patterns
										of methylation in healthy individuals and those with type 1 diabetes. Moreover,
										we show these Markov Models are generalizable by using them to predict age
										given unseen methylation sites and benchmark their performance against a linear
										regression baseline and deep neural network.</p>
